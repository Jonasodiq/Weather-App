# Weather-App

## Purpose of the app:

**The app is designed to provide the user with current weather information for a selected city. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and displays the results in a user-friendly interface.**

## Functionality:

**Search function:**
The user can enter the name of a city in a text input field and press the search button or press the "Enter" key to start the search.

**Get weather data:**
When the user initiates a search, the app retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the specified city. The API key is used to authenticate the request.

**View weather information:**
The app displays the weather information in an interface that includes an image representing the weather condition (for example, sunny, rainy, or snowy), the temperature, a description of the weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.

**Error handling:**
If the search returns no results, for example if the city was not found, the app displays an error message and hides the weather information.

**Use:**
The user can use the app to check the weather of different cities by entering the city name and then see the result on the screen.

**Technical description:**
The app is implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses the Fetch API to communicate with the OpenWeatherMap service and DOM manipulation to update the interface with the weather information.
